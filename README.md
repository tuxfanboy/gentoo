# gentoo
Here, I host my Gentoo configuration files. This includes my kernel config, make.conf, package.use, etc.

I'm not a full-time Gentoo user, however I switch hop over to it every once in a while when I get the itch to install it again.

## My Gentoo desktop
(not a copy of Mental Outlaw's at all)
